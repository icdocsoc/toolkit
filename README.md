# DoCSoc Toolkit

A simple set of tools for doing common tasks, for use by the DoCSoc committee.

Current contents:
- **teachdb** - Small utility library for interfacing with TeachDB.
- **fb-filter** - Checks members of Facebook groups (e.g. freshers' groups) against TeachDB, to help weed out sneaky people and/or spies.

Feel free to add more tools, or translate the ones we have into other languages for your convenience.
